{"body":"## Personal info\r\n- Email: rtnpro@gmail.com\r\n- Blog: http://ratnadeepdebnath.wordpress.com/\r\n- Code: @rtnpro\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nI am a geek and an open source hacker. I work for https://www.transifex.com. I develop and test for Transifex. I am also a FOSS contributor. Apart from Transifex contribute to Fedora, Pontoon (a Mozilla project), Askbot and Ankur Bangla projects. I usually develop in Python and use Django for web development. I also have experience with developing Gtk based desktop applications. I have been a Fedora user since 2008 and I am a Fedora Ambassador.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\nKeep learning and improving myself to devise elegant solutions for existing problems in the society.\r\n\r\n## Experience\r\n#### Software Developer and QA at Transifex , September 2011 – Present\r\nAt Transifex, I develop new features, enhance existing ones and implement support for various i18n file formats. I also write tests to ensure that things run as they are expected to. User support, bug triagging and bug fixing is also a part of my job. At Transifex, we innovate to take localization to the next level. Below are a few things(among many) that I have done so far at Transifex:\r\n- Implement and enhance [file format](http://help.transifex.com/features/formats.html#user-formats) handlers.\r\n- Implemented [Glossary](http://help.transifex.com/features/glossary.html#glossaryv2) feature.\r\n- Implemented _related tag cloud_.\r\n- Implemented [translation strings API](http://help.transifex.com/features/api/index.html#translation-strings).\r\n- Implemented a super fast test suite\r\n- Fix and update tests.\r\n- Bug-triagging & bug-fixing.\r\n- Handle user queries and bug reports at [support.transifex.com](support.transifex.com) and over live chat at [Transifex](www.transifex.com)\r\n\r\n#### Summer Intern at Transifex , June 2011 - August 2011 (3 months) \r\nIt was an awesome experience to work as an Intern at Indifex. I got introduced to a plethora of new technologies all of a sudden. I went through a steep learning curve and finally it paid off. I contributed to Transifex, increased test coverage for Transifex, fixed bugs, added support for new i18n file fomats. I also worked on implementing new features for Transifex, like, Glossary, tag assignment, etc.\r\n\r\n## Interests \r\n`Spirituality` `FOSS` `Web development` `Database design` `Fedora` `Kernel` `Device Drivers` `Filesystems`\r\n\r\n## Skills \r\n`Python` `Django` `GTK+` `JavaScript` `jQuery` `Testing` `CSS` `HTML` `AJAX` `Linux`\r\n\r\n## Projects \r\n1.

For this we use the scatternet formation and \r\n> route maintenance algorithms proposed in “Location aware route maintenance protocols for mobile \r\n> Ad Hoc networks”, which reconstructs optimal routes in a mobile Ad Hoc Bluetooth network. Our \r\n> algorithm named Enhanced Mobility Aware Routing (EMOLAR) deals with secure data transmission \r\n> during route reconstruction proposed in Location aware route maintenance protocols for mobile Ad \r\n> Hoc networks.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- **Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay**, Manager, Software Engineering at Red Hat, sankarshan.mukhopadhyay@gmail.com\r\n- **Dimitris Glezos**, CEO, Transifex, glezos@transifex.com\r\n- **Konstantinos Bairaktaris**, Lead Engineer, Transifex, kbairak@transifex.com\r\n- **Runa Bhattacharjee**, Technical Translator III at Red Hat, runa.misc@gmail.com\r\n- **Kushal Das**, Software Engineer at Red Hat, kushaldas@gmail.com\r\n- **Shreyank Gupta**, Software Engineer at Red Hat, shreyankg@gmail.com","name":"Ratnadeep Debnath","google":"","tagline":"Software Developer and QA, Transifex","note":"Don't delete this file!
